## Lab Questions

### Lab Summary
In this lab we created a few different circuits, including a simulation of a light switch, a half adder, and a full adder. In the top.v file we implemented the light and half adder circuits individually, while also creating a two bit adder by connecting two full adders together, using the carryout from the first full bit adder as the carry in for the second.

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
